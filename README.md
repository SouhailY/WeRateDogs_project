# We Rate Dogs, a data wrangling project

The aim here is to wrangle data coming from a twitter account called "We rate dogs". This twitter account rates and comments dog pictures shared by people.

The first challenge will be to gather data from a variety of sources in different formats :
- Manually (downloading a csv)
- Programatically through url (tweet image predictions file in tsv format)
- Programatically through Twitter's API tweepy (tweet in Json format)
